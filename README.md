# AI-Powered Retail Business Intelligence & Decision Support System

## Problem Statement
Retail businesses generate large volumes of transactional data but often struggle to convert it into actionable insights.  
This project builds an end-to-end business intelligence and analytics system to analyze retail transaction data, track key performance indicators (KPIs), identify customer behavior patterns, predict churn, and forecast future sales to support data-driven decision-making.

## Objectives
- Analyze retail transactional data to uncover revenue and customer behavior trends
- Build interactive BI dashboards for executive-level insights
- Implement machine learning models for sales forecasting and churn prediction
- Deliver data-driven recommendations to support business decisions

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQL (MySQL)
- Power BI
- Machine Learning (Forecasting, Classification)

## Project Structure
- `data/` – Processed datasets  
- `notebooks/` – Data cleaning, EDA, and analysis  
- `sql/` – SQL schema and analytical queries  
- `dashboards/` – BI dashboards  
- `models/` – Machine learning models
